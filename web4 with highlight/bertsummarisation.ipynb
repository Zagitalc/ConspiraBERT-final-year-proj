       " 'summary': 'Existing law, The Student Online Personal Information Protection Act, restricts the use of information about elementary and secondary school students by operators of certain Internet Web sites and online services and applications by, among other things, prohibiting operators from engaging in targeted advertising, amassing student profiles except for K–12 school purposes, or selling or disclosing student information, as specified. Existing law also requires an operator to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the covered information to protect the information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.\\nExisting law also prohibits an operator of an Internet Web site or online service from knowingly using, disclosing, compiling, or allowing a 3rd party to use, disclose, or compile the personal information of a minor for the purpose of marketing or advertising specified types of products or services. Existing law also makes this prohibition applicable to an advertising service that is notified by an operator of an Internet Web site, online service, online application, or mobile application that the site, service, or application is directed to a minor.\\nThis bill would, commencing on July 1, 2017, prohibit the operator of an Internet Web site, online service, online application, or mobile application that is used primarily for preschool or prekindergarten purposes, as defined, and was designed and marketed for preschool and prekindergarten purposes, to knowingly engage in specified activities with respect to their site, service, or application, including, among other things, engaging in targeted advertising, using specified information to amass a profile about a pupil except in furtherance of preschool or prekindergarten purposes, and selling or disclosing a pupil’s information, as specified. The bill would also require an operator to, among other things, implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the information to protect that information from unauthorized access, and to delete a pupil’s information at the request of a preschool, prekindergarten, or district, as specified. The bill would authorize the disclosure of a pupil’s information under specified circumstances. The bill would also provide that its provisions are severable.',\n",
